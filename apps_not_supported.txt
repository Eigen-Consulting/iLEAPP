APPS NOT SUPPORTED BY iLEAPP - ANALYSIS RESULTS
===================================================

Date: 2025-07-17
Analysis of extraction: /Users/js/consulting_work/side_projects/iLEAPP/extraction/

## SUMMARY:
This analysis compared the iOS apps found in the provided extraction with the apps currently supported by iLEAPP artifact scripts. The results show several third-party apps that are present in the extraction but do not have corresponding artifact support in iLEAPP.

## METHODOLOGY:
1. Analyzed all artifact scripts in /Users/js/consulting_work/side_projects/iLEAPP/scripts/artifacts/
2. Extracted __artifacts_v2__ and __artifacts__ dictionaries to identify supported apps
3. Explored the filesystem extraction to identify installed third-party apps
4. Extracted bundle identifiers from app Info.plist files
5. Cross-referenced to identify gaps in support

## CURRENTLY SUPPORTED THIRD-PARTY APPS:
Based on analysis of 250+ artifact scripts, iLEAPP currently supports ~50+ third-party apps including:
- WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Discord, Slack
- BeReal, Instagram, TikTok, Bumble  
- LinkedIn, Microsoft Teams, Splitwise
- Uber, Life360, Booking.com
- Chrome, ChatGPT, Google Translate
- And many others (see apps_currently_supported.txt for full list)

## THIRD-PARTY APPS IN EXTRACTION:
From the filesystem extraction, the following third-party apps were identified:

### APPS NOT SUPPORTED BY iLEAPP:

0. **Snapchat** (com.toyopagroup.picaboo) - ✅ COMPLETED
   - Social media platform with ephemeral messaging
   - Implemented: Snapchat artifact parser with messages, memories, user data
   - Status: Successfully tested and working - extracts 7 message entries and 18 user data entries
1. **Trello** (com.fogcreek.trello)
   - Project management/collaboration app
   - Likely data: boards, cards, tasks, team collaboration data
   - Potential artifacts: boards, cards, comments, attachments, user activity

2. **Reddit** (com.reddit.Reddit) - ✅ COMPLETED
   - Social media platform
   - Implemented: Reddit artifact parser with posts, comments, user profiles, preferences
   - Status: Successfully tested and working

3. **Pinterest** (pinterest)
   - Visual discovery platform
   - Likely data: pins, boards, searches, user activity
   - Potential artifacts: pins, boards, searches, user profile, saved content

4. **PictureThis** (cn.danatech.xingseus)
   - Plant identification app
   - Likely data: photo analysis, plant identifications, user library
   - Potential artifacts: plant identifications, photos, search history, user library

5. **Despicable Me** (from DespicableMe.app)
   - Mobile game
   - Likely data: game progress, achievements, user data
   - Potential artifacts: game progress, achievements, user statistics, in-app purchases

6. **Sequoia Translator** (from SequoiaTranslator.app)
   - Translation app
   - Likely data: translation history, language preferences
   - Potential artifacts: translation history, language pairs, user preferences

7. **f.app** (Bundle ID unknown)
   - Unknown app (needs further investigation)
   - Potential artifacts: TBD based on app identification

### APPS ALREADY SUPPORTED BY iLEAPP:
- **TikTok** (com.zhiliaoapp.musically) - ✅ SUPPORTED (Messages, Contacts, Search)
- **Discord** (com.hammerandchisel.discord) - ✅ SUPPORTED (Chats, Account Data)
- **Instagram** (com.burbn.instagram) - ✅ SUPPORTED (Threads) [partial support]

## PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS:

### HIGH PRIORITY (Popular apps with rich forensic data):
1. **Reddit** - Major social media platform, rich user activity data
2. **Trello** - Popular business/productivity tool, collaboration data
3. **Pinterest** - Visual content platform, user behavior insights

### MEDIUM PRIORITY:
4. **PictureThis** - Niche but potentially interesting user behavior data
5. **Sequoia Translator** - Translation history could be forensically relevant

### LOW PRIORITY:
6. **Despicable Me** - Gaming data, less forensically significant
7. **f.app** - Unknown app, needs identification first

## NEXT STEPS:
1. Prioritize Reddit artifact development (high user base, rich data)
2. Research Trello's data storage patterns (SQLite databases, plists)
3. Investigate Pinterest's local data caching
4. Expand Instagram support beyond just Threads
5. Examine each app's container directories for database files and artifacts

## TECHNICAL NOTES:
- All apps follow standard iOS container structure
- Most likely use SQLite for local data storage
- Check Documents/, Library/Application Support/, and Library/Caches/ directories
- Look for .sqlite, .db, .plist, and .json files
- Consider Core Data implementations for some apps

## CONTAINER LOCATIONS:
- Trello: /private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/61BFA770-7DAF-4FF3-8B47-1008D606FD54/
- Reddit: /private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/7077AB3E-75C8-4A5E-A2DE-70727CC14144/
- Pinterest: /private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/26796BF9-5A5D-441E-91F1-1EAFDAC28937/
- PictureThis: /private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/96FA9EDC-5E58-4C40-8A60-DE6980801271/

This analysis provides a clear roadmap for expanding iLEAPP's support for additional iOS applications found in real-world extractions.
